## HTML [Links](links), CSS [Layout](layout), JS [Functions](functions)

### Links

```
<a href="url">link text</a>
```

- Email link

```
<a href="mailto:webmaster@example.com">Jon Doe</a>
```

- Opening link in a new window

```
<a href="url" target="_blank">Jon Doe</a>
```

### Layout

1. Key concepts in positionong elements
   - block-level el
   - inline el

2. Controling the position of elements 
   - normal flow (position:static)
   - relative positioning (position:relative)
   - absolute positioning (position:absolute)
   - fixed positioning
   - floating positioning

The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float.

3. A "fixed-width" layout is one in which the layout of the page is contained within a wrapper that doesn't adjust its size when the width of the browser changes.

4. Liquid Layouts is a layout in which the width of main container is flexible( in percentage).

5. The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

6. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

7. It is possible to include multiple CSS files in one page.

### Functions

1. A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

```
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
```

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- How does pair programming work?

Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

- Why pair program?

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
